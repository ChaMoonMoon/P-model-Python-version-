# P-model-Python-version-
This Python version of P-model are base on (https://github.com/stineb/rpmodel).
Please note that ChaMoonMon is not the author of P-model, but only rewritten this package in Python 3.6, if you have any academical 
problems, please contact the authors(https://github.com/stineb/rpmodel).

ChaMoonMoon hope this P-model(python version) can help the students who have a necessary to learn the P-model but unfamilar
with R language, those students or researchers can use this python version to help you start with your code journey, because Python now
have experiencing fast growing community members and more and more university and organization have had published their results or ancilary 
tools via python, so it is more easily to use python to couple the two different model together.

------------╭(′▽`)╭(′▽`)╯  Code detail  ╭(′▽`)╭(′▽`)╯-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Both [calc.py] and [fuc.py] are include some calculation processess, [Pmodel.py] is the P-model whole workflow and capsule as a fuction, 
so you can use this function as an isolate equation in any other mature model, [developer manual.py] contain the variables name and 
variables definitions but not so complete yet, untill now, I just spend over 3 days to done this job, so you can find some mistakes in the 
whole code, ChaMoonMoon hope users can feedback the mistakes and ofcourse ChaMoonMoon will help users to fix it as soon as possible.

More important is that, this version of P-model only supprot the number calculation but not ARRAY and MATRIX!

Thank you, ChaMoonMoon really hope this code can help you!
Best wishes
